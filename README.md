# rock-paper-scissors
Revisted on 19,Nov as per odinproject demand: 
now html is linked to myRev code:
- buttons instead of dropdown select for each choice.
- dynamically update logs and results to DOM instead of alerts
- use Math.floor 
- first to 5 wins
- lesbianism hidden path

This is the first project I made after learning few javascript basics.

The player competes against the computer, with scores tracked until one side reaches three wins.

Features

Choice Selection: The player selects "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" from a dropdown.

Computer Random Choice: Each round, the computer generates a random number between 0-1 and then a computer choice is assigned.

Winner Determination: A function determines the winner based on game rules, updating scores and alerting players about round results.

Game Reset: The game resets once three rounds is won by player or computer.

my javascript solution is named myCode

Chatgpt's revision on my code is in the file named chatGptRevision.
