# rock-paper-scissors
This is the first project to me made after learning few javascript basics.

The player competes against the computer, with scores tracked until one side reaches three wins.

Features

Choice Selection: The player selects "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors" from a dropdown.

Computer Random Choice: Each round, the computer generates a random number between 0-1 and then a computer choice is assigned.

Winner Determination: A function determines the winner based on game rules, updating scores and alerting players about round results.

Game Reset: The game resets once three rounds is won by player or computer.
